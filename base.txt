SHOW CONCEPT (Revised)
In the year 2200, Earth has finally confirmed the existence of parallel universes and extra-dimensional planets, some more powerful and older than Earth. A brilliant but cold-hearted scientist (unnamed yet) works not for humanity’s safety, but for fame. He dreams of creating the first super-soldier, a defender of Earth—under his name.

After humans refuse to participate in his experiment, he stumbles upon a mother cat and her 5 kittens in the countryside. Here’s your missing link:

He discovers a rare neural energy signature in the cats' brains—similar to humans—but purer and more adaptable. It’s called Synaptium-X—a lost evolutionary potential only animals still carry.

Obsessed, he steals the kittens and runs over the mother, killing her coldly. He takes them to his lab, planning to inject ancient predatory DNA from Universe 3221, Planet 55—an old Earth-like world stuck in the dinosaur era.

Using a machine, he extracts power from the extinct saber-toothed tigers, collecting their primal force into a battery. But unknown to him, a baby saber-tooth, Rock, is born during this process. The machine ignores Rock as weak and useless—but he watches in horror as his entire species dies.

Later, a coding mistake back on Earth causes a power surge. The machine activates in reverse, sending hyper-advanced alien tech and saber-tooth DNA back to Rock, turning him into the first ever intelligent, evolved super-beast.

At the same time, the 5 kittens mutate—each developing unique abilities, advanced intelligence, and personalities centuries ahead of mankind.

The result:

5 mutated, genius cats now walk the Earth.

A lone saber-tooth named Rock, the only one of his kind, wants revenge.

The scientist has no idea what he has unleashed.
